Three photo collages address the, in everyday life, disappearing awareness of the reality of industrial food production in todayâ€™s consumer society: Fruit and vegetables from distant countries; Meat, not as a slaughtered animal, but as a product in a refrigerated shelf; The idyllic farm that exists only in advertising and in our heads.

The three prints were exhibited at the SOHO Festival 2016 in Vienna.
