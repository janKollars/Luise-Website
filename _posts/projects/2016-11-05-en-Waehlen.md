An old rotary dial telephone and a small address book lie on a shelf. The book is filled with fictional contacts, such as people, institutions, help-lines, shops, etc., which by their names actually imply a "Wahl" (German noun for choice, election). For one comes across the act of “wählen” in various forms in everyday life: I dial a telephone number or vote for a president; I make small, big, good, and bad choices. In all of the kinds of “wählen”, power, responsibility, decision, and conflict play certain roles that naturally change according to the person and situation. The installation deals with the stereotypes and dynamics of “wählen” and invites one to participate in the act of choosing, dialling, selecting.

The installation was displayed in June 2016 as part of the exhibition No matter what, in the Tabor, Vienna.
