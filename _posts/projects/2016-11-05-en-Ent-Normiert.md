In advertising the human body is standardised: only bodies that comply with the constructed beauty ideals of the advertising industry are shown, everything else is left unrepresented.

(De-) Standardised 1 was exhibited as part of the Winter 2015 Rundgang of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, the second work was displayed at the Fluc, near the Viennese Prater in Summer 2016.
